# vending-machine-frontend-ajax

This was a fun little project writing the front end for an existing REST server that simulated a vending machine. The crux of this
project is the jQuery AJAX functions that take the raw JSON from the server and turn it into dynamic HTML to display on 
the browser. It's not the prettiest web page, but it's functional and it was a great way to hone my JavaScript and jQuery skills
after 8 weeks of doing almost exclusively back end code.
